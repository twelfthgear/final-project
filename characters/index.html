                        A pirate turned man of Sol after a rough encounter on the seas. Avulig was never one for religion growing up. His family only had the essentials, and even then they didn't have that. This led to life of pirating and thievery on the seas. Eventually, Avulig realizes he never  wanted to hurt anyone as he careened down this path with no way out. Late one night on the rocky seas, Avulig found himself praying. He prayed for help for his family. His call was answered the next morning, boarded and attacked by a Luxon naval boat. They executed everyone on te ship, save for Avulig, who spared at the whims of a priest. His life was spared on one condition: that he himself follow the way of the light and join the clergy. The Addock Coast is Avuligs home now.

                        Not much is known about this mysterious man. He often is seen smoking a pipe and writing in a his book. Everywhere he goes he is seen with these two items. Whether is be the bar, the brothel, or the bank, Fandan makes sure he is capturing every minute detail in his book. What he writes, no one is sure. One thing is for sure however... He seems to have an air of agelessness about him. A mysterious figure for sure.

                            Nemmonis has never really been an adventurer before. Back in the Bornbreath Mountains where he was raised, Nemo was a musician for hire. Day to day, he worked in the various taverns and inns, making quick, easy cash with the power of his charm alone. On one fateful day, however, that all changed for him. While searching for work, Nemo stumbled upon an underground crime ring planning to rob the bank reserves of the town. They planned to swamp the town with an avalanche from the nearby mountians. Nemo, very heroically, stopped the heist with the help of a local dragon. After these feats of his, Nemo was requested to join the infamous Sparks guild in the capitol.

                            Kitsune are a simple breed of Beast Folk. Said to live for hundreds of years, kitsune are often seen travelling the world in packs. Rarely do you see a lone kitsune. Emi, however, varies from the pack in many ways. Born from a Sol shard, a magical form of currency in this world, this curious mountain fox explores the world, making friends and along the way. Whether is it other humans or other small critters, Emi enjoys the company. Emi has left her pack in the Tikai Isles, the place she calls home.

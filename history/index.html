                            Just as a precursor, this collaborative timeline covers the events of those who came before up until the creation of this book.

                        Time for some of these beings does not reflect similarly to beings like us humans. A single <text class="year">mega-annum (Ma)</text> refers to a measurement of time equal to one-thousand millennia, or ten-thousand centuries. For Empirical measurements, 1 mega-annum is also referred to a million years.

                        Now, It is unclear if this is exactly when Sol began it's expansion, but it is best supported by the resources gathered through from various surviving texts and orations passed through the ages. Everything before the third

                        Before there was light, there existed a period of dark. A darkness that lasted longer than anything that has come into existence, and will long exist after everything comes to an end. This is the Void. 
                        <br><br> 
                        For eons this darkness filled the empty planes of existence. Time was irrelevant, location was void, nothing was everything. This was, until the "spark," happened. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Something, somewhere sparked a massive amount of energy to slowly expand outwards, filling this dull, empty void with bright, warm light. This pure energy is more commonly referred to as Sol. 
                        <br><br> 
                        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-4500 Ma:</text> The first theorized instance of Sol's expansion into the known universe began, creating planetary systems across the universe. This is referred to as "The First Spark." 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-4000 Ma:</text> A second spark occurs, creating billions of tendrils of pure light energy that expand outwards into the inky blackness of the universe. This is referred to "The Kindling." 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-3500 Ma:</text> Our galaxy is formed from various tendrils of Sol. Our 13 planets formed into one planetary system around our two suns, Aos and Bel. Solaris is a burning ball of rock and flame, devoid of life. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-3000 Ma:</text> Fundamental forces develop on Solaris. This includes the magic that is taught today. Gravitational forces begins to pull the planet together. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-2500 Ma:</text> Solaris falls into the first ice-era after eventually burning off most of the surface. This lasts nearly 300 Ma. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-2200 Ma: </text>The first ice-era ends. Rapid reheating causes a large chunk of the planet to separate, creating our first moon, Cerci. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-1500 Ma:</text> First oceans form, landmasses come into shape. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-1000 Ma:</text> The first signs of primordial life begin to take place in the ocean. We see this in fossils. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-250 Ma:</text> Small, quadrupedal creatures begin to make their journey onto landmasses. Fish and vertebrae-based animals are developing quickly in the ocean. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-200 Ma:</text> The first sentient Titans,  walk the planet, harnessing the leftover tendrils of Sol. These were the first magic inhibitors. They are referred to as Ophirius, Luxxin, Diacres, Enoc. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-100 Ma:</text> The first Titans develop the basics of runic magic. Mile tall stone tablets depicting archaic runes have been discovered, displaying the ingenious, yet crude developments of the first magic users. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-66 Ma:</text> An unforeseen asteroid collides with Solaris, wiping out the titans and other menial forms of life on the planet. The second ice-era begins. The collision sends another chunk of the plant into orbit, creating our second moon, Delphin. This Asteroid is referred to as the "The First Striking." 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-55 Ma:</text> The first reptilian mammals walk the land. Some have developed the innate ability to harness the energy in the air. Thus began the Age of Dragons. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-40 Ma:</text> The first Grand Dragon Clash occurs. These beasts were able to wreak havoc on the lands with the use of Titan arcana. Mountains and oceans were created in the wake of these creatures and are still observable today. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-30 Ma:</text> After 10 Ma of infighting, there is common ground found between the dragons as they find their place of rest among the various landmasses. Territories have been declared and won and an age of peace ensues. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-10 Ma:</text> Portals to fey planes open inexplicably. Creatures of astral and celestial nature mingle with the mammals of Solaris. This gave birth to various creatures and beasts capable of higher intelligence and sentience. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-6.5 Ma:</text> The first homo sapien bipedal creatures walk the planet. First came the land walkers, eventually evolving into what we know as Humans. Some were accepted by fey and celestial beings, eventually giving way to what we know as the Elves. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">6.4 Ma:</text>- Smaller, bipedal beings begin to leave their subterranean homes in search of basic survival needs. These gave way to Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, and other various smaller humanoids. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-6 Ma:</text> There is a third expansion of Sol. Small waves of light collide with Solaris, imbuing it with energy and arcana unfamiliar to the already existing creatures. This creates rifts to various extra planar dimensions. Few brave souls explored these rifts. Some beings come out of the rifts and are the basis of many of the common Beastfolk, and lesser races known. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-5 Ma:</text> More rifts open, and descendants of those who dared to travel into the rifts before return. Archaic scribes and writings declare that this is when the Goliath is introduced to Solaris. Roughly around this time when Tieflings take root into Solaris. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-1 Ma:</text> The first signs of civilization begin to occur. Remnants of these civilizations can be seen today buried beneath many cities and in many ruins. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-500 millennia:</text> Fighting began between the High Elves and Dwarves over resource laden lands. The first major war between these two parties began. This encounter lasted 7 centuries and is often referred to as the "7 Centuries War." Dards often have described the war as a "long and fruitless fight with no clear start or finish in sight." The Dwarves contracted the Gnomes to create machines of war for their armies. However, this only led to more destruction and needless bloodshed. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-250 millennia:</text> The first Titan's Tablet is discovered. The tablet belonged to Ophirius. Little was known about the tablet, but there were a few who took the time to study the landmark. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-200 millennia:</text> Diacres Tablet was discovered among the landmasses we now refer to as the Tikai Isles. More study into the mystery of the arcanum began.  
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-190-25 millennia:</text> An age of recorded historical absence begins. There have been no recorded texts, scrolls, or mentioning of what happened during this time period following the study of Diacres Tablet. Some scholars have theorized that another war among the dragons began, destroying any record of the history during this period. Some believe that is was the gnomes, as after this period, little is known about their whereabouts on the planet, even to this day. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-10 millennia:</text> Civilization is beginning to develop at a rapid speed as the first major civilizations are being developed. The major land masses receive their respective names from their respective inhabitants. To the Northeast lies the Ophirion Domain. The South is the endless tundra of the Isocone Peaks. The East bares the Diacrand Federation. Located betwixt them all is the Luxon Empire. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-5 millennia:</text> All at once, several breakthroughs occur in the arcana that has been studied for the last 245 Ma. Several base runes are developed from the Titan Tablets and give way to new arcane discoveries. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-2.5 millennia:</text> The first fully developed school of arcana is completed. The school of Illusion Magic was the first to be fully developed by a guild of Halfling magicians known as "The Radiant Sect." Eventually they branched out into other forms of magic. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-1 millennia:</text> Whether it was pure Halfling luck, or rewards from years of study, seven other schools of magic are then fully developed by the sect, but kept closely guarded as secrets. Outsiders begin to feel cautious around this guild as tensions rise between commoners and sect members. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-750 Centuries (C):</text> Around the time tensions were rising terribly fast, a secret Sorcerer sect formed after gathering intel on the Radiant Sect. They were known as the "Serpent's Shell." Texts declare that they were formed by a group of concerned humanoids and beast folk who wanted a countermeasure against the Radiant Sect if they were to act out of line. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-500 C:</text> New religions begin to pop up across the globe. Mainly "The 4 Divines," The One Sol," and the "Dragon's Eye," comprise the main three. The Radiant Sect falls under The One Sol series of churches and beliefs. The Serpent's haven't been discovered and have been stealing and developing various magic from the Radiant Sect. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-250 C:</text> Grand Magicians of The Radiant Sect begin to feud over the ownership of land and cities. This began the second biggest war of the planet. New arcana come out from the various schools of magic developed by the Radiant Sect. The war is one fought with much bloodshed. Dwarves flee to various underground bastions across the globe to develop technology the world has yet to witness. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-200 C:</text> One third of the world's population of all intelligent humanoids is lost to war between arcana-based armies. Many unintelligent races are forced to fight at the whim of the Radiant Sect despite their best efforts. While 1/3 of the whole population is lost, nearly ninety percent of all orcs were lost to Radiant necromancy infighting. Even after death those who lost their lives were forced to fight. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-185 C:</text> Solaris begins to quake across the globe, a groaning is heard during these quakes. They continue for 3 years before suddenly stopping in the middle of the Winter. By this time, what is left of the orcs 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-184999:</text> Grand Sorcerer Atmos, of the Serpent's Shell, releases the casting on an unknown 3 year spell that changes the fate of Arcana as we know it. This spell, often referred to as the "Second Striking." His spell ripped a 30 mile radius chunk of earth out of the ground and levitated it 30 miles into the air. The basis of this spell has been lost to the ages but he used it to change the course of the war. For every day this war raged on he doubled the height of the ball, declaring an ultimatum to the warring parties. If nothing were to change, he would drop the ball from an obscene height and drop Solaris into a another ice-era devoid of all life. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-184998:</text> One week following Atmos' declaration, the Radiant Sect ends their infighting and submits to Atmos in their fortress, as he is now hundreds of miles in the air. This is when the Second Striking Occurs. Atmos, chunk by chunk, returned the sphere of rock back to Solaris. But he didn't do so calmly. One by one he destroyed everything the Radiant Sect had built. Homes, churches, castles, everywhere a member of the Radiant Sect was, he crushed it. This Striking nearly eradicated what was left of the halflings on Solaris. It was as bad, if not worse than the war they started that nearly eradicated the orcs. After he had returned all of the sphere, he was never heard of again. Texts have declared that he has been seen multiple times after his disappearance, but fail to provide a description of what he looked like. Even today we don't know who Atmos was, or how he rose to such power. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-184995:</text> In the years following the Atmos' Disappearance, distrust between those who could use magic and those who could not rose. Riots in the major settlements and cities broke out. Violence began to separate the magic users from the common folk. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-184994:</text> The first "Wizard Hunts," begin. Magic users are being burned at the stake. Militia are being formed to destroy Arcane texts and hunt any form of magic users. Those that aren't caught are forced to take exile in the neighboring countries. By this point, the Serpent's Shield has relocated to countries outside of Lux. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-184954:</text> By the point in time, new laws have been put in place regarding magic. It has been outlawed for anyone to use. Anyone caught using is taken away and sent to a prison known as the Icebox. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-100 C:</text> For almost almost 85 centuries there was a ban on magic. The kings and magistrates of the various nations declared magic unethical and harmful after the Second Strike occurred. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-50 c:</text> Many magically supported kingdoms have fallen since the hard ban on magic. Despite the severity of these bans, countless fruitless wars were still fought over land and kingdoms. Whether it be to lack of knowledge or the lack of surviving text from this era, arcana was destined to come back. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-13 cs:</text> Goblins return from the depths of the Underreach, a lost Dwarven metropolis Strike. However, they aren't he goblins the world remembers. Generally goblins are of a shorter stature and feral nature. Having spent so much time in seclusion has caused drastic changes in their physical appearance. Rather than a murky green complexion and warts on their skin, their skin has become more pale and smooth, similar to that of a human. They have become more intelligent and sentient. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-12 C:</text> The first goblin king was elected around this time. The lifetime expectancy of a goblin has expanded close to that of a human, thus allowing them to reproduce and live similarly to other humanoids. Many of the modern royal bloodlines are of pure Goblin-Kin blood. Although most hold no traditional form of power outside of the capitals, that doesn't mean they don't take their heritage seriously. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-6 C:</text> Peace finally befalls the world as all of the continents have come under a universal peace treaty under King Efford. King Efford was a very compassionate Half-Dwarven hero. Born of a wood elf Mother and mountain Dwarf Father, he had the stature of a giant but the charisma of a bard. Appointed the king of Luxon after several years of service in the army, he brought ideas of peace and trust among the nations. Trusted by both the Dwarves and the Elves, he was able to end any malice brought between the two races. For 5 centuries he reigned until befalling to a terrible sickness in 543. His statue can be seen in the Capital City among the Hall of Heroes. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">-10:</text> Magic has slowly made a comeback ever since Efford's death in -605. During his reign he spent a lot of time trying to practice what little magic he could find access to. This inspired a new wave of youth to take up the magic that was once practiced and abused. In the year of -10, something strange began to happen in the sky. A small white orb appeared, separate from the sun. It gave off no harsh light like the sun. It steadily increased in size over the course of the next 10 years. 
                        <br><br> 
                        <text class="year">Sol's Fourth Expansion:</text> The light never stopped growing in those ten years. It only grew closer and closer to Solaris, getting larger in size. Then it happened: the last recorded expansion of Sol. A chunk of what appeared to be pure light flew from the void straight to Solaris. It was an astronomical event. The ball of pure light flew into our atmosphere. It was a physical thing. For 3 weeks this mile wide orb of pure light floated mere feet above the surface of our planet. Many came to see the spectacle, as it was the only recorded instance of a being of Sol appearing on Solaris. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then, it expanded. Rather, it shattered. The orb itself began to expand into a bright, white light before crystallizing and shooting out like an explosion of nothing but shards of pure, prismatic color. The shards scattered across the globe, arcing in orbit before eventually crashing down all across the globe. Not only did we witness a major event, this was the rebirth of magic itself. This date has been celebrated with a festival of colors every summer solstice.

                        <text class="year">001 After Sol's Expansion (ASE):</text> The arrival of Sol's light poured pure magical essence back into the world. Magic research began again, but strictly for educational purposes. It is not until half a century later that all 8 schools of magic are rediscovered and taught across the globe.

                        <text class="year">051 ASE:</text> Now there is an ever stretching peace across the lands. Commerce and trade is blooming, kingdoms are flourishing in trade and invention. We now enter The Age of Thought.

                        <text class="year">065 ASE:</text> Magic has been applied to physical items in the form of runic carvings. Artificers have developed their own methods of imbuing magic into mundane objects. An Elven Woman named Alexandra Grange-Belle developed a way to  apply various forms of evocation magic to allow for long range communication across the world. This is the start of a new world of magic. Soon after range boosting towers were built across Luxon and around the major cities of other continents.

                        <text class="year">125 ASE:</text> Despite all the good happening in the world, beasts began to form across the world. Some physical, others beings of pure, inky blackness. These creatures seem to form around where shards of Sol have landed or collected. This inspired the beginning of the Soldier Initiative.

                        <text class="year">130 ASE:</text> High Queen Efford, a direct descendant of King Efford, began the Spark Guild Initiative, an adventurers guild aimed at keeping the peace of Solaris against the creatures  and beasts of the voids It has been discovered and disclosed that these beings of darkness formed around the shards themselves and feed off the shards to absorb more of them. These shards are precious commodities in the world  as there are only a finite amount of them. They can be traded with the guild for coin or used in bartering as legal tender.

                        Despite the gaps in our history, we have a lot to learn from the past. Going forward we must continue to strive to understand what it is that created us and avoid repeating what those have done before. 
                        
                        Thanks for your time.
